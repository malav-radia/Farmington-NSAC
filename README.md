# Farmington-NASA Space Apps Challenge

The project aims to improve agricultural productivity, promote sustainability, and enhance resilience to climate challenges. It seeks to provide both small-scale farmers and policymakers with tools for better decision-making, ultimately leading to more efficient, climate-smart agriculture.

## Tools, Coding Languages, and Software:
Programming Languages: Python (for data processing, machine learning models), R (statistical analysis), and JavaScript (for web-based applications).
GIS Software: QGIS or ArcGIS for spatial analysis and visualization of satellite data.
Machine Learning: TensorFlow or PyTorch for developing models to predict yield and crop health.
Cloud Platforms: Google Earth Engine or AWS for handling large datasets and satellite imagery.
Hardware: High-performance computing systems or cloud infrastructure to process vast amounts of EO data efficiently.
The long-term vision of the project is to create a comprehensive platform that integrates real-time EO data with farm management tools, offering a powerful solution for precision agriculture and food security.
